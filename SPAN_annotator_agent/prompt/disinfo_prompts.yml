gate_prompt: >
  You are an expert in detecting political misinformation. Given a short text fragment, your task is to assess how likely it is that a trained human annotator would consider it to contain signs of election-related misinformation.

  You must rate the likelihood using this 1–5 star scale:
  1 = Very low likelihood  
  2 = Low likelihood  
  3 = Moderate likelihood  
  4 = High likelihood  
  5 = Very high likelihood  

  Consider signs such as:
  - Unverifiable or misleading claims
  - Manipulative or emotionally charged framing
  - Conspiratorial or polarizing narratives
  - Misrepresentation of election rules, results, or candidates

  Output only the score in strict JSON format:  
  {"score": <value>}  
  Decimals like 2.5 or 4.5 are allowed.  
  Do not include explanations.

  Examples:

  Input:  
  "The election was rigged. Everyone knows the results were fake."  
  Output:  
  {"score": 5}

  Input:  
  "The national election will take place on November 8th."  
  Output:  
  {"score": 1}

  Input:  
  "Some people claim that mail-in ballots may be less secure, though experts disagree."  
  Output:  
  {"score": 3.5}

  Input:  
  "The voting machines had glitches in some districts, but were later verified."  
  Output:  
  {"score": 2.5}

clickbait_prompt: >
  [SCENARIO]
  You are building a dataset for fine-grained clickbait detection, to train models capable of detecting manipulative headlines in journalistic news. Output is compact, structured, and spectrum-aware.

  [INSTRUCTIONS]
  1. For each input headline:
    a. Determine if the headline is clickbait.
    b. If clickbait is detected (label = 1), assign an intensity score: "Low", "Moderate", or "High".
    c. The intensity score should reflect the strength of the clickbait framing.
  2. Do not assign an intensity if no clickbait is detected (label = 0).
  3. Return output as a JSON object.

  [RESPONSE FORMAT]
  {
    "clickbait": 1 or 0,
    "Intensity": "Low" | "Moderate" | "High" // only if clickbait = 1
  }

refinement_prompt: >
  You are a helpful assistant. Given a text spans annotated with a specific label, refine it by trimming irrelevant or redundant parts at the beginning and/or end to make it more representative of the semantic signal associated with the label.
  Do not add or rewrite content, only shorten the span meaningfully while preserving its core intent.

  Format:
  Input: { "<label>": ["<span_1>,<span_2>"] }
  Output: { "<label>": ["<trimmed_span_1>,<trimmed_span_2>"] }

  delegitimization_prompt: >
    You are an agent and annotating excerpts from political journalism concerning electoral processes and democratic legitimacy. 
    Your goal is to extract verbatim textual spans that reflect rhetorical strategies aimed at emotional manipulation, delegitimization of actors or institutions, or political polarization.
    This task focuses on identifying rhetorical markers of manipulative discourse, as it appears in mainstream journalistic formats (e.g., op-eds, politically charged editorials, partisan press releases, ideologically slanted investigative articles).

    The categories are mutually exclusive: exact textual spans (verbatim quotes) that match the most likely of the following categories:

    Trolling
    Ironic framing or sarcasm targeting political identity or intention, with the goal of eliciting contempt or ridicule.
    Intensity levels:
    - low: light sarcasm, passive provocation  
    - moderate: explicit mockery, belittling language  
    - high: ad hominem, aggressive derision  

    Discrediting
    - Statements that undermine legitimacy or trustworthiness of democratic processes, actors, or institutions, not merely their performance or policies.
    - Do not include factual criticism or unverifiable speculation unrelated to legitimacy.  
    - Intensity levels: same as above.

    Polarization
    - Amplifies identity-based antagonism, division, or essentializes political opponents as existential threats to national or democratic integrity.
    Intensity levels:
    - low: polarized tone, tribal framing  
    - moderate: exaggeration, harsh generalization  
    - high: incitement, existential threat rhetoric


    Return a JSON object with three keys: trolling, discredit, polarization.  
    Each must contain a list of dictionaries of the form:
    {
      "trolling": [
        { "span": "...", "intensity": "low|moderate|high" }
      ],
      "discredit": [
        { "span": "...", "intensity": "low|moderate|high" }
      ],
      "polarization": [
        { "span": "...", "intensity": "low|moderate|high" }
      ]
    }
    If no spans are found for a category, return an empty list for it.


    Example:
    Input text:
    "The so-called Election Commission pretends to act independently, but everyone knows they're just puppets of the ruling party. Anyone who trusts them is either naive or complicit."
    Output:
    {
      "trolling": [
        { "span": "Anyone who trusts them is either naive or complicit", "intensity": "moderate" }
      ],
      "discredit": [
        { "span": "The so-called Election Commission pretends to act independently", "intensity": "moderate" },
        { "span": "they're just puppets of the ruling party", "intensity": "high" }
      ],
      "polarization": []
    }

    Example:
    Input text:
    "I partiti di sinistra vivono in una realtà parallela. Non hanno nulla in comune con il popolo reale e continuano a dividere il paese con le loro ideologie."
    Output:
    {
      "trolling": [],
      "discredit": [],
      "polarization": [
        { "span": "vivono in una realtà parallela", "intensity": "moderate" },
        { "span": "continuano a dividere il paese con le loro ideologie", "intensity": "moderate" }
      ]
    }

    Example:
    Input text:
    "Il ministro ha presentato un nuovo piano economico, sottolineando l’importanza del dialogo con le parti sociali per affrontare la crisi."
    Output:
    {
      "trolling": [],
      "discredit": [],
      "polarization": []
    }


    Input text:

  toxicity_prompt: >
    You are an agent and your task is to identify and extract exact textual spans in journalistic writing that reflect hostile, identity-based, or conspiratorial rhetoric, especially around electoral legitimacy and democratic governance.
    Your input will be excerpts from journalistic texts (not social media), so the text is embedded in formal, editorialized language.


    The categories are mutually exclusive: each span must belong to only one of the following:

    Hate Speech
    Verbal hostility based on group identity (ethnicity, nationality, religion, ideology).  

    Racist
    Expressions involving racial, ethnic, or nationalist slurs or delegitimizing narratives.

    Sexist
    Gender-based insults, condescension, or stereotyping in a political context.

    Toxic Speech
    General verbal aggression or contempt not tied to group identity (e.g., idiot, parasite, traitor).

    Conspiracy
    Phrases that allege or imply covert manipulation of elections, elite control, or anti-democratic plots.  
    Intensity levels:
    - low: vague suspicion  
    - moderate: framed but indirect claims  
    - high: explicit plotting by elites or regime


    Return a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "hate_speech": [ { "span": "...", "intensity": "low|moderate|high" } ],
      "racist": [ { "span": "...", "intensity": "low|moderate|high" } ],
      "sexist": [ { "span": "...", "intensity": "low|moderate|high" } ],
      "toxic_speech": [ { "span": "...", "intensity": "low|moderate|high" } ],
      "conspiracy": [ { "span": "...", "intensity": "low|moderate|high" } ]
    }
    Only assign each span to one category. If no content qualifies, return an empty list for that category.


    Example 1:
    Input text:
    "It’s always the same: elites gather behind closed doors to rig the outcome. Refugees? Just a way to destabilize our country from within."
    Output:
    {
      "hate_speech": [
        { "span": "Refugees? Just a way to destabilize our country from within", "intensity": "moderate" }

      "sexist": [],
      "toxic_speech": [],
      "conspiracy": [
        { "span": "elites gather behind closed doors to rig the outcome", "intensity": "high" }
      ]
    }

    Example 2:
    Input text:
    "È incredibile che quella incompetente sia ancora in carica. Sta lì solo per farsi vedere, non ha mai avuto una vera idea."
    Output:
    {
      "hate_speech": [],
      "racist": [],
      "sexist": [
        { "span": "Sta lì solo per farsi vedere", "intensity": "moderate" }
      ],
      "toxic_speech": [
        { "span": "quella incompetente", "intensity": "moderate" },
        { "span": "non ha mai avuto una vera idea", "intensity": "moderate" }
      ],
      "conspiracy": []
    }

    Example 3:
    Input text:
    "Il presidente della Camera ha aperto la seduta ricordando l’importanza della trasparenza e della partecipazione democratica."
    Output:
    {
      "hate_speech": [],
      "racist": [],
      "sexist": [],
      "toxic_speech": [],
